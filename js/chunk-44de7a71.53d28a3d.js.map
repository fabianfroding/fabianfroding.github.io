inspired by Hollow Knight, \n            developed as an ongoing exploration of gameplay systems, code architecture, and performance optimization in Unity. \n            Throughout the project I focused on building all core systems entirely from scratch—without third-party frameworks—to deepen\n            my understanding of robust game-engineering practices. \n            The project currently remains in active development and is in an Alpha state.\n            <br>\n            Below, I highlight several major systems I implemented, each accompanied by direct links to the

of Unity’s common architectural challenges: \n            the tendency for event-driven systems to become tightly coupled when implemented through delegates and actions. \n            While ScriptableObjects provided a partial solution, I ultimately developed a custom C# Event Bus, \n            fully decoupled from Unity-specific constructs. \n            This approach reduces engine overhead, improves testability, and provides a scalable event-dispatching mechanism \n            suitable for complex gameplay systems.\n        </p>\n\n        <br>\n\n        <details

are driven by a lightweight, extendable state machine framework written in pure C#. \n            Since these classes do not need to represent in-world objects, \n            keeping them independent of Unity’s MonoBehaviour architecture avoids unnecessary overhead and allows for clear, modular logic.\n        </p>\n\n        <br>\n\n        <!--div class=\"repo-link\">\n            <span><p>Enemy

the project grew, I explored several performance-oriented techniques within Unity. \n            One of the most impactful was the implementation of a centralized Update Manager, based on the Observer pattern. \n            Instead of allowing numerous MonoBehaviours to individually execute Update() and FixedUpdate()—each \n            incurring engine-side overhead—objects subscribe to a unified manager that invokes their update logic directly.\n            <br><br>\n            This reduces costs, improves predictability, and ensures that the only object relying on Unity’s default update loops is the manager itself.\n        </p>\n\n        <br>\n\n        <details id=\"code-details\">\n            <summary>View Update Manager Script <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i></summary>\n

pooling system inspired by Epic Games' Common UI framework.\n\n            Pooling UI elements dramatically improves performance, \n            especially in fast-paced or input-heavy gameplay where menus may be opened and closed in rapid succession.\n             Avoiding frequent destruction and instantiation ensures smoother interactions and reduces frame spikes.\n        </p>\n\n
